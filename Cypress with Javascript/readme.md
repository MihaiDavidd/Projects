This folder is an example of the tests I wrote for different purposesses :


- Critical Flow is an E2E testing of the website, which focuses specifically on testing the essential or critical functionalities of the application. This testing ensures that the most important user journeys or workflows within the website are functioning correctly from start to finish. It helps identify any issues or bugs that could potentially disrupt the user experience during these critical interactions.

- API response validation involves checking the JSON response from various endpoints. This practice aids in comparing data between the master and branch versions, facilitating the identification of data errors if they occur.

- API testing involves verifying the values returned by each endpoint to ensure their accuracy and consistency. This process involves sending requests to the API endpoints and then inspecting the responses to validate that they meet the expected criteria.

- Snapshot Testing utilizes Percy to compare snapshots, identifying any visual discrepancies if there are any issues. This ensures that the visual appearance remains consistent and accurate across different states or versions of the application.

- VIP Clients undergo a data accuracy verification process across various user profiles to ensure that the information displayed on the platform aligns precisely with the data stored in the database.
